C++ API Reference
=================



The following sections present the C++ API Reference. All types are
within the :ref:`sixtyfps<namespace_sixtyfps>` namespace and are accessible by including
the :code:`sixtyfps.h` header file.

If you choose to load :code:`.60` files dynamically at run-time, then
you can use the classes in :ref:`sixtyfps::interpreter<namespace_sixtyfps__interpreter>`, starting at
:cpp:class:`sixtyfps::interpreter::ComponentCompiler`. You need to include
the :code:`sixtyfps_interpreter.h` header file.
